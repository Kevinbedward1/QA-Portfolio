# QA-Portfolio

This repository contains Quality Assurance artifacts created as part of my learning and
practical experience in software testing. It demonstrates my understanding of QA
fundamentals, exploratory testing, and version control using Git.

The content in this repository reflects my learning process and is intended to show how I
approach testing, document findings, and manage test-related work.

## Exploratory Testing

This section includes my first iteration of an exploratory testing session. The purpose of
this session was to explore the application, identify potential issues, and document
observations without relying on predefined test cases.

### Contents
- **Test Charter** – Defines the goal and scope of the exploratory session
- **Areas Covered** – Lists the features and sections explored during testing
- **Test Notes** – Records observations, questions, issues, and risks identified

This exploratory session is an initial iteration and may be expanded or refined as testing
continues.

## Git Learning and Version Control

This section demonstrates my foundational understanding of Git and how version control is
used to manage QA artifacts and collaboration in a team environment.

### Topics Covered
- Cloning repositories
- Committing changes
- Pushing changes to a remote repository
- Creating and managing branches
- Merging branches
- Handling merge conflicts
- Viewing and reviewing commit history

Screenshots are included to show hands-on practice with these Git concepts.

## Tools and Technologies
- Manual testing techniques
- Exploratory testing
- Git & GitHub
- Documentation and reporting

## Notes
Some materials in this repository are works in progress and are intentionally shared to
demonstrate my learning process, testing approach, and documentation style.

This portfolio will continue to evolve as I gain more experience and complete additional
testing activities.
