# QA-Portfolio

This repository contains Quality Assurance artifacts created as part of my learning and
hands-on practice in software testing. It demonstrates my understanding of QA
fundamentals, testing techniques, and supporting tools used in real-world QA work.

The content in this repository reflects both completed work and ongoing learning, and is intended to show how I approach testing, document findings, and continuously improve my skills.

## Exploratory Testing

This section includes exploratory testing sessions conducted to evaluate application behavior without predefined test cases.

### Contents
- **Test Charters** – Define the goals and scope of each exploratory session
- **Areas Covered** – Features and components explored during testing
- **Test Notes** – Observations, issues, questions, and risks identified

Exploratory testing artifacts may be updated or expanded as additional sessions are completed.

## Git Learning and Version Control

This section demonstrates my understanding of Git and how version control supports QA activities and collaboration within a team.

### Topics Covered
- Cloning repositories
- Committing changes
- Pushing changes to a remote repository
- Creating and managing branches
- Merging branches
- Handling merge conflicts
- Viewing commit history

Screenshots are included to show hands-on practice with these concepts.

## Bug Reporting and Defect Management (Planned)

This section will include:
- Documented bug reports
- Clear reproduction steps
- Expected vs actual results
- Severity and priority classification

These artifacts will demonstrate my ability to identify, document, and communicate defects
effectively.

## Robotic Process Automation (RPA) (Planned)

This section will include learning and practice related to Robotic Process Automation,
including:
- Understanding automated workflows
- Identifying repetitive test scenarios
- Supporting manual testing through automation concepts

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Manual testing
- Exploratory testing
- API testing (Postman, Swagger)
- Bug reporting and defect tracking
- Git & GitHub
- Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
